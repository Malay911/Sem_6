          This project demonstrates how easy and powerful Next.js becomes when 
          combined with clean UI design techniques such as dark mode, gradients, 
          soft glows, and glass-morphism.

          Next.js allows fast rendering, SEO advantages, file-based routing, and 
          both client & server components — making it perfect for modern web apps.
